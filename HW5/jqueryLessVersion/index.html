        <h1>YOUR GAME BACKLOG</h1>
        <p>Keep track of all the games you got from across different platforms, all on one site!</p>
        <br>
        <p>IDEA BEHIND PROJECT:</p>
        <p>Over the years, video games have become easier to obtain both monetarily and conveniently
            with the ease of downloadable content and various online storefronts providing sales for hundreds of popular
            games everyday. Because of this, it seems that a lot of gamers both casual and avid will amass large
            collections of digital-only video games that either simply never get played due to forgetfullness or
            impulsiveness to spend money.</p>
        <p>This program was created to directly respond to said phenomenom, keep track of your collection of video games
            on various platforms and figure out what's been played given a proper chance as well as reconsider coming
            back to games once forgottren from the past. Ideally a user's list of games can be exported to be shared
            with others through a .txt file.</p>

        </ul>
        <p>(Misc. idea, not final)</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Show bar graph/percentage of each category of Current/Finished/Dropped games?</li>
            <li>Show popularity of games from specific developer companies and platform (Big 5: Nintendo, PlayStation, Xbox, PC, misc.)?</li>
            <li>Entertaining fact using total hours of all finished games and equating it to something else (ie: "You could have watched Toy Story 28 times instead of playing all these video games!"</li>
            <li>Ordered list of top-rated games?</li>
            <li>Organize A-Z in all appropriate categories across all pages (see: any Wikia page with a table element)</li>
        </ul>
